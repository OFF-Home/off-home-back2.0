# Backend code of our software engineering project: OFF-Home

# Technologies used:
* Deployment in AWS EC2 (We are no longer paying for the service, so server is down).
* Containerized in Docker (Docker script for deployment and unpdating the server code).
* Tested with Mocha and Chai.
* Databases are Firebase (user data) and sqlite3 (everthing else).
* Used Express.js and documented in Postman.
* Analysis with Amazon CloudWatch and Postman Monitor.
* IDE: Webstorm.
